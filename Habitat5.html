    <h1>Ocean Habitat</h1>
    <p>An ocean habitat refers to any sea or ocean; these salty waters are home to many creatures and plants. The ocean habitat, all joined together, is the largest habitat on Earth, covering about 70% of the surface of our planet.</p>

    <p>animal Fish</p>
    <p>Fish are aquatic vertebrate animals that have gills but lack limbs with digits, like fingers or toes. Recall that vertebrates are animals with internal backbones. Most fish are streamlined in their general body form. The word fish is the same whether it is singular or pluralâ€”you can talk about one fish or ten fish.</p>

    <p>animal Shark</p>
    <p>Though there are exceptions, sharks typically have a tough skin that is dull gray in colour and is roughened by toothlike scales. They also usually have a muscular, asymmetrical, upturned tail; pointed fins; and a pointed snout extending forward and over a crescentic mouth set with sharp triangular teeth.</p>
