    <h1>Grassland Habitat</h1>
    <p>Grassland habitats can be found on more than 40% of the land on Earth. They are wide, open areas where mostly grass and flowers grow. Grassland habitats are very common, and there are many different kinds depending on the sort of climate they're found in.</p>

    <p>animal Tiger</p>
    <p>Tigers are powerful hunters with sharp teeth, strong jaws and agile bodies. They are the largest terrestrial mammal whose diet consists entirely of meat; the largest tiger ever recorded was an Amur tiger. The tiger's closest relative is the lion. In fact, without fur, it is difficult to distinguish a tiger from a lion.</p>
