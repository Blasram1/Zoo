    <h1>Desert Habitat</h1>
    <p>What are desert habitats? Deserts are places that don't get much rain, and are very dry. They can be either hot places, or cold places. Because deserts don't have much water, animals that live in the desert are able to conserve water and keep their body temperature at the right level.</p>

    <p>Rattlesnakes are highly specialized, venomous reptiles with large bodies and triangle-shaped heads. They are one of the most iconic groups of North American snakes due to the characteristic “rattle” found at the tip of the tail.</p>
