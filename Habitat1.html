    <h1>Rainforest Habitat</h1>
    <p>Rainforests are lush, warm, wet habitats. Trees in the rainforest grow very tall because they have to compete with other plants for sunlight. Kapok trees, which are found in tropical rainforests around the world, can grow to 200 feet.</p>

  <p>animal Butterfly</p>
  <p>Butterflies have six jointed legs, a pair of antennae and three body parts called a head, thorax (chest), and abdomen (tail end). The four wings and the six legs of a butterfly are attached to its thorax. Special sensors on a butterfly or moths' feet allow the insect to taste their food.</p>
